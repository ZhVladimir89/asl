# Macro Assembler AS V1.42 Beta Build 119 Readme
Macro-assembler AS by Alfred Arnold

I personally use it as a macro-assembler for Intel 8080. This is the best multi-platform macro-assembler for Intel 8080 I've seen so far.

This fork has no functional changes from the original version and only contains minor fixes related the complation on MacOS.

The project was forked from the version 1.42 build-.
